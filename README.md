# **Superradiance-Superabsorption Cycle Simulation**  

This repository contains two Python scripts that simulate the dynamics of a **superradiance-superabsorption cycle**, producing various intensity and population graphs. The project was developed in **2022** while I was learning Python for my master's degree project with the help of my good friend **João Valeriano** (https://github.com/joaovaleriano), and I later adapted the scripts to **C++**.  

## **Project Overview**  

The project consists of two main scripts:  

1. **Superradiance-Superabsorption Intensity & Population Graphs**  
   - Computes and plots the **intensity graph** of a full superradiance-superabsorption cycle.  
   - Generates the **population graphs** of the **σ_z states** for:  
     - \( g = 0 \)  
     - \( N = 1 \)  
     - \( N = 1000 \)  

2. **Angular Variables & Pulse Intensity Analysis**  
   - Simulates and graphs the **angular variables** and **pulse intensity** within a **short time interval**.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (original implementation)  
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting)  
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)  
- **SciPy** (for solving differential equations)  
- **C++** (adapted version)  

## **How to Run the Scripts**  

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Leon-MRR/Masters_Superrad_Superabs_2022.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
   ```
